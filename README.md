# python_coding

A master graduation project done in year 2020 with the combination of cryptography and steganography for image embedding process to hide a secret image underneath a cover image.
The StegEmbed_Extrac_Final.py are the finalize version of the code. However, due to recently cleaning in the coding folder. One of the function has been missing 'AES_func'(a function to generate Galois Field Multiplication dynamically). To run the Python files without error prompt, replace the AES related code with the AES_Base.py from the reference folder, as it will directly refer to the GF table instead of using function to generate the values.

Since the project has been a long time not maintained, 

Whoever is interested in recreating the function or create your own version of the function, you can refer to Pablo Caro Github for more info: https://github.com/pcaro90/Python-AES-base

I post the source code for anyone who interested in continues or refer as needed.

Thanks.
