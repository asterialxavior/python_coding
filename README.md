# python_coding

A master graduation project done in year 2020 with the combination of cryptography and steganography for image embedding process to hide a secret image underneath a cover image.
The StegEmbed_Extrac_Final.py are the finalize version of the code. However, due to recently cleaning in the coding folder. One of the function has been missing 'AES_func', a function to generate Galois Field Multiplication dynamically. To run the Python files without error prompt, replace the AES related coding with the AES_Base.py from the reference folder.
Since it's had been long time did not maintain the project, it takes way too long to re-create the function.

Whoever is interested in recreating the function can refer to Pablo Caro Github for more info: https://github.com/pcaro90/Python-AES-base

I post the source code for anyone who interested in continues or refer as needed.

Thanks.
